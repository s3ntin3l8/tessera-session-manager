// Bridges browser terminals to real, host-persistent processes.
//
// Each Session owns exactly one node-pty child: a `dtach` attach-client. That
// client is dtach's *only* attaching process — dtach itself never sees more
// than one, which is what keeps it chrome-free and resize-clean (see the
// plan's persistence discussion). Any number of browser WebSocket connections
// may subscribe to that single child's data stream and write to it; the
// fan-out/fan-in across tabs happens here in the manager, not in dtach.
//
// The child is spawned once and kept alive for as long as this Node process
// runs, independent of how many browser tabs are attached — closing the last
// tab does NOT kill it. That means the common case (browser tab closes,
// reopens later, Node process never restarted) never needs a fresh dtach-level
// reattach at all: the scrollback ring buffer below is a continuous,
// gap-free record of everything the session produced while unwatched, so
// replaying it reconstructs the screen exactly. A fresh OS-level `dtach -a`
// attach (and the redraw-reliability question in Risk 1 of the plan) is only
// needed when this Node process itself restarts and the child is gone.
//
// The underlying dtach *master* (which actually owns the program) is a
// separate, untracked, fire-and-forget process bootstrapped once via `dtach
// -n` — see Session.spawn() for why conflating master and attach-client was
// Milestone 1's first real finding.
