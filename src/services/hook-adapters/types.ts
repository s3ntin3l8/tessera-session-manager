// Phase 2 (issue #174) — the per-agent hook adapter framework. Different
// agents wire hook config in different ways (an ephemeral CLI flag, an
// ephemeral env var, a managed file write — see the plan's "Per-agent
// integration research" table), but the spawn seam in pty-manager.ts needs
// one uniform shape to call regardless of which agent it's launching. Each
// concrete adapter (claude-code.ts today; codex.ts/agy.ts/opencode.ts in
// follow-up PRs) implements this interface once and is registered in
// index.ts's ADAPTERS list — the spawn seam itself never special-cases an
// agent by name.
