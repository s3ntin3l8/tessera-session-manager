// Codex adapter (issue #252). Unlike Claude Code/OpenCode, this is NOT an
// ephemeral, per-session injection — verified this PR against the real
// installed Codex CLI and its own hook documentation, both facts the
// original plan got wrong:
//
// 1. `CODEX_HOME` is not a surgical "relocate just the hooks" knob like
//    OpenCode's `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` — it relocates EVERYTHING (auth,
//    model config, MCP servers, trusted-project state, history). Pointing
//    it at a fresh per-session scratch directory breaks Codex outright
//    (`codex doctor` reports "no Codex credentials were found" against an
//    empty CODEX_HOME) — not a graceful degradation, a broken agent.
// 2. Even with a real, populated config, Codex requires an explicit,
//    interactive one-time trust decision (`/hooks`) before ANY non-managed
//    command hook — including one Mullion generates — is allowed to run.
//    "Managed" hooks that skip this review require an enterprise
//    `requirements.toml` deployed via MDM/system tooling, not writable by
//    an ordinary user process. The only non-interactive bypass is
//    `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` — a flag that disables the trust
//    review GLOBALLY for that invocation, including for any hooks a cloned
//    repo's own `.codex/hooks.json` ships (a real unreviewed-code-exec
//    vector for a tool whose job is running agents against arbitrary
//    repos). Not used here, on purpose — see issue #252 for the fuller
//    writeup.
//
// Given both, this follows the SAME "managed, reversible install" pattern
// the plan already approved for agy/OpenCode-fallback (not the plan's
// original "pure env, no argv edit, no managed install" bullet for Codex,
// which was written before either fact above was verified): an idempotent,
// Mullion-owned merge into the user's REAL `~/.codex/hooks.json` (never a
// throwaway scratch file), keyed off `forwarderPath` so re-running this on
// every launch only ever replaces Mullion's OWN group — any other hooks the
// user has configured themselves are left completely untouched. Real
// CODEX_HOME (auth/config/MCP) stays intact, and because trust is recorded
// against the REAL, stable home rather than a fresh-per-session one, a
// one-time `/hooks` trust grant persists across every future
// Mullion-launched Codex session — it just isn't automatic. Until a user
// grants that trust, these hooks are silently skipped and Codex behaves
// exactly as it does today (the PTY-parsed attention channel is
// unaffected either way).
//
// Only `Stop` and `PostToolUse` are registered — Codex has no `Notification`
// event at all (confirmed against its hook docs), and gating hooks
// (`PreToolUse`/`PermissionRequest`) are deliberately deferred to issue
// #178, same reasoning as Claude Code's deferred `PreToolUse`: no endpoint
// exists yet to answer a real gate decision.
