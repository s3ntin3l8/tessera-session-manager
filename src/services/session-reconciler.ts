/**
 * Detects sessions whose program exited on its own — user typed `exit`, a
 * crash — rather than via an explicit DELETE /api/sessions/:id. Fixes the
 * M2-era gap: such a session left a stale dtach socket with `status` still
 * "active" forever, so the next getOrCreate() would silently bootstrap a
 * fresh program under the same id instead of surfacing that it had ended.
 *
 * Source of truth is each host's own isMasterAlive (the session's systemd
 * scope on whichever host owns it — local via app.pty, remote via
 * SessionBackend/RemoteHostClient), not anything tracked in this process's
 * memory — so this correctly catches a session that exited before this
 * process ever re-attached to it (e.g. right after a restart). Only
 * "active" rows are checked: "killed" and previously-reconciled "exited"
 * rows are already-settled and skipped.
 *
 * Grouped and queried one bulk call per host (issue #26) rather than one
 * call per session — and critically, a host that's merely unreachable right
 * now is *skipped entirely*, never treated as "every session on it is
 * dead": a transient network blip to a healthy remote agent must never
 * mass-flip its sessions to "exited" (the dtach masters are almost
 * certainly still fine; only an affirmative "not alive" from a *reachable*
 * host is trusted).
