// --- Attention state machine (issue #171 / #98) -------------------------
//
// Replaces the old ad-hoc "bell followed by another chunk within
// ATTENTION_CLEAR_WINDOW_MS clears it" check that used to live directly in
// pty-manager.ts's Session.onData. That check had a real false-positive
// bug: a rapid burst of bells during heavy TUI output (confirmed against
// Claude Code's Ink renderer and Codex) set `attentionAt` — and emitted a
// #166 `attention:true` event — on literally the FIRST bell in the burst,
// then cleared it a chunk later, then set it again on the next bell, and so
// on for the whole burst. Each of those was a real, if short-lived, false
// alarm: any WS/event consumer polling or subscribing mid-burst would see
// "needs attention" for a session that's still very much working.
//
// The fix is to never report attention as true until a candidate signal has
// gone UNCONTRADICTED for long enough to be confident it's genuine — i.e.
// an explicit PENDING_ATTENTION state between "a candidate signal arrived"
// and "confirmed, tell the world". A signal is confirmed once
// ATTENTION_CONFIRM_MS[kind] has elapsed with no further output arriving to
// contradict it (see advanceAttention's "tick" input below); any output
// arriving before that — a fresh candidate signal (which just restarts the
// pending window with the newest kind/timestamp, so a whole burst just
// keeps re-arming rather than ever confirming) or plain output (which
// cancels the pending signal outright, since continued output IS the
// "still working" evidence) — means it was never real attention at all, so
// nothing is ever reported or emitted for it. This is deliberately a PURE,
// synchronous reducer — no `Date.now()`/timers/emitEvent calls in here —
// so `test/services/attention-detect.test.ts` can exercise every
// transition, threshold and the burst-false-positive regression directly,
// without needing fake timers or a real Session. See pty-manager.ts's
// Session for the (small) stateful wrapper: it feeds chunks in via onData
// and periodic real time via its own tick(), and turns `emit`/`log` below
// into actual emitEvent("attention", ...) calls and debug log lines.
