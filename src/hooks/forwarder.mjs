// Shared shell-command-hook forwarder (issue #174) — invoked by every
// shell-command-hook agent's generated config (Claude Code and Codex today;
// agy reuses this same file in a follow-up PR, see the plan's Cross-cutting
// "Forwarder" section) as:
//
//   node <this file> <agent> <kind>
//
// with the hook's own JSON payload on stdin. Reads stdin, maps it (via
// forwarder-core.mjs's pure per-agent dialect) to hook-protocol message(s),
// connects to $MULLION_HOOK_SOCKET, sends the handshake + one or more
// message lines, and exits. Deliberately plain JavaScript, not TypeScript:
// this file is spawned
// directly by an external agent's own hook runner, not imported by Mullion's
// server process, so it must run identically under `make dev` (tsx never
// touches it — there is no dist/ yet) and in production (`make build` copies
// src/hooks/ into dist/hooks/ byte-for-byte, no tsc step to go stale — see
// package.json's build script). A .ts version of this file would need a
// compiled twin kept in sync by hand for dev, which is exactly the
// dev/prod path mismatch this design avoids.
//
// PR4 registers ONLY non-blocking hooks (Notification/Stop/PostToolUse), so
// this shim is pure fire-and-forget: connect, write, exit — no reply is
// ever awaited. The blocking review-gate path (PreToolUse, waiting on a real
// human decision) is deliberately deferred to PR9 (issue #178), which is
// where this file gains a bounded blocking-read-then-stdout-decision branch
// alongside the endpoint that actually answers it — see PR4's description
// for why shipping a blocking hook now, with nothing to resolve it, would
// hang every real tool call instead.
