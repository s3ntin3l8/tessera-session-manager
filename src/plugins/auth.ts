/**
 * Optional in-process auth for the primary role (issue #19) — a single
 * shared token, checked via a global onRequest hook that also covers the
 * /ws/terminal upgrade (onRequest fires before that upgrade completes, the
 * same guarantee routes/internal.ts's own token gate and terminal.ts's own
 * preValidation hook rely on). Registered after dbPlugin, before
 * previewProxyPlugin (see src/app.ts's comment at that call site) — that
 * ordering is what lets this hook run, and potentially reject, before
 * previewProxyPlugin's own onRequest hook gets a chance to proxy a
 * preview-host HTTP request.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT gate the preview-host surface itself (a Host header
 * matching PREVIEW_BASE_HOST): a Lax, host-only session cookie cannot reach
 * a cross-subdomain preview iframe (SameSite=Lax excludes cross-site
 * subresource loads, and a host-only cookie is never sent to a different
 * subdomain regardless of SameSite), and a browser <iframe> can't attach a
 * Bearer header either — gating that surface with this mechanism would
 * silently 401 every browser preview the moment auth is enabled, a
 * regression hiding behind a config flag. Preview hosts stay exactly as
 * protected as they are today: by whatever gateway forwardAuth the operator
 * has in front (deploy/README.md already calls out that the preview router
 * needs the same middleware as the main one — this isn't a new gap, just an
 * unclosed one). A real fix — a short-lived, dashboard-minted preview-access
 * token appended to the iframe URL, validated by preview-proxy.ts itself —
 * is a follow-up, not this PR.
