// and PaneTab.tsx (notifyKind, issue #168); pulled out here for #169 so the
// notification panel can reuse the exact same rules instead of a third,

// 1:1 (payload shapes there are the source of truth) — update this
// alongside any new kind/payload field.

// "attention" color treatment. Returns null when this specific event's
// kind/shape isn't one this has been taught about yet (a future payload
// change, or a kind this hasn't been taught).

// update), alt-screen status_change (fires on every TUI open/close), and
// (Phase 2) file_change (fires on every reported edit) — all routine,
// high-frequency, and not what a user means by "notification". A hook
// `notification` message already counts via the existing "attention" kind
// check below (see pty-manager.ts's Session.emitHookEvent, which emits it
// under kind "attention" just like every PTY-parsed signal); `review_gate`
// in state "waiting" is the one Phase 2 addition that needs its own check
// here, since it's its own NotificationEvent kind, not folded into
// "attention". Used by PaneTab.tsx's unread tab badge (issue #168) and
// NotificationBell.tsx's event feed + unread bell count (issue #169) — both
// must agree on this set, or the panel and the tab badges it's meant to
// summarize could disagree.
