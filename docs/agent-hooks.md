# Agent hook socket

Mullion's Phase 1 notifications are inferred from raw terminal bytes (BEL,
OSC sequences, title changes) — a channel every agent gets automatically,
with zero integration work. Phase 2 adds a second, **structured** channel on
top of that, for agents that want to report richer, machine-readable events
(file changes, review-gate requests, progress) than terminal escape sequences
can carry.

An agent that never uses this channel is completely unaffected: the socket
exists (like the per-session dtach sockets already do) but nothing connects
to it, and every existing PTY-parsed notification keeps working exactly as
before.

## What's injected

Every session's shell gets two extra environment variables at spawn time,
alongside whatever its launcher command already sets:

| Variable              | Meaning                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `MULLION_HOOK_SOCKET` | Absolute path to a Unix domain socket, shared by every session on this host.   |
| `MULLION_HOOK_TOKEN`  | A per-session secret, unique to this one session, used in the handshake below. |

Both are stripped from a session's env if that session itself starts a
nested Mullion (e.g. running `make dev` from inside a Mullion-managed
terminal) — the same env-leak protection `session-env.ts`'s
`SERVER_ENV_KEYS` already applies to every other Mullion-owned config value
(issue #70).

## Wire protocol

Connect to `$MULLION_HOOK_SOCKET` and write newline-delimited JSON, UTF-8
encoded. The **first line** on every connection must be a handshake
identifying which session you're speaking for:

```json
{ "token": "<the value of $MULLION_HOOK_TOKEN>" }
```

An unknown, forged, or malformed token closes the connection immediately —
there is no error reply for a failed handshake, only a closed socket. A
successful handshake attributes every subsequent line on that connection to
this session; you don't need to repeat the token.

Every message after the handshake is validated JSON, one object per line.
The message shapes themselves (`notification`, `progress`, `file_change`,
`review_gate`, `fork`, `join`) are defined in a follow-up PR alongside this
one — this first PR wires up the socket and the handshake only; any line
sent after a valid handshake is currently accepted and logged, but not yet
parsed or routed anywhere.

## Security notes

- The socket file is created with `0600` permissions — only the user
  Mullion runs as can connect at all.
- The per-session token is a defense against a **different** session's hook
  messages being forged on this shared socket, not against that session's
  own child processes (which legitimately inherit `$MULLION_HOOK_TOKEN`, the
  same way any other env var is inherited).
- A session's token is regenerated every time its process is (re)spawned —
  killing a session invalidates its old token immediately, even if the same
  session id is reused later.
